# AlphaFold

## 0. Introduction
In short AlphaFold is groundbreaking AI system that is making research faster in almost every aspect in the fields of biology. To use AlphaFold the system first takes in a sequence of an amino acid and will then predict three dimensional structure of a protein and does so with extremely fast calculations.

This section on AlphaPhold will go through how to use AlphaPhold on Elja.

## 1. Getting Started

### 1.1 Installation

There are many ways to get AlphaFold installed. The installation method that was used to install AlphaFold on Elja was using github clone on the following github repository developed by Deepmind (creators of AlphaFold): 
https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold.git.

On that repository is a [**Docker**](https://Docker.com) file but [**Docker**](https://Docker.com) will not be implemented on the HPC environment due to **security issues**. What was then decided was to add another git repository into the system called AlphaFold_non_docker which can be gotten from the following github repository: 
 https://github.com/kalininalab/alphafold_non_docker.

## 2 Run AlphaFold on Elja
:::note
**Required:** It is recommended to run AlphaFold on the open-source terminal tmux to maintain an interactive session. To know how to tmux check on the following page about  [Interactive Sessions](/docs/elja/interactive_session#maintained-interactive-sessions) on Elja.

It is required to run AlphaFold on an sbatch. To submit it as a job to the SLURM queue, more on that on the following section: [Submitting Batch Jobs](/docs/elja/submit_jobs)
:::

### 2.1 Loading AlphaFold
Before being able to run AlphaFold on Elja, you will have to load the AlphaFold module. To do this you type these following commands in the terminal:

```bash
[..]$ ml use /hpcapps/libbio-gpu/modules/all/
[..]$ ml load AlphaFold
```

---

### 2.2 Running AlphaFold 
To run AlphaFold you will have to go to the location /hpcapps/dource/AlphaFold and you do so by typing the following:

```bash
[..] $ cd /hpcapps/source/AlphaFold/
```

Next things and the final step is to run AlphaFold. To run AlphaFold you will have to type ```run AlphaFold.sh``` with parameters which you can find [here](https://github.com/kalininalab/alphafold_non_docker#running-alphafold-v231). An example of an AlphaFold-run would look like this: 

```bash
[..] $ run_alphafold.sh -d /AlphaFoldData/AlphaFold/data -o /hpcapps/source/alphafold_non_docker/dummy_test/ -f /hpcapps/source/alphafold_non_docker/example/query.fasta -t 2020-05-14
```
