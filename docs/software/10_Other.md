## Software
### Common Software
Softwares that are put into this category may vary, from programming languages to a whole pipeline. They are placed into this category because they are the most common softwares that are generally used for research and general work across different fields. Here below are those softwares and a short description of them and what they provide to the user. 
 

- **GCC** (GNU Compiler Collection): A set of compilers for programming languages like C, C++, and Fortran, widely used for scientific computing and software development.

- **OpenMPI**: A widely used implementation of the Message Passing Interface (MPI), crucial for parallel and distributed computing in scientific and engineering simulations.

- **BLAST+**: A suite of tools for sequence similarity searching and analysis, commonly used in bioinformatics and genetics research.

- **PyTorch:** Deep learning framework used for developing and training neural network models, popular in machine learning research.

- **SAMtools**: Tools for manipulating sequence alignment (SAM/BAM) files, essential for genomics and bioinformatics research.

- **BEDTools**: A toolkit for genome arithmetic used for manipulating genomic intervals, widely used in genomics research.

- **VCFtools**: Tools for working with variant call format (VCF) files, important in genetics and genomics research.

- **GROMACS**: A molecular dynamics simulation software widely used in computational chemistry and biomolecular research.

- **HISAT2**: A popular tool for aligning RNA-seq data to genomes, essential in transcriptomics research.

- **Vasp**:atomic scale materials modelling, e.g. electronic structure calculations and quantum-mechanical molecular dynamics, from first principles.

- **Pism**: The Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) is an open-source modelling framework for ice sheets and glaciers. It is parallel, thermodynamically-coupled and capable of high resolution. 

- **OpenMM**: OpenMM is widely used in the field of computational chemistry and molecular dynamics simulations. OpenMM is an open-source toolkit for molecular simulation, allowing researchers to perform high-performance simulations of biomolecules using a variety of force fields and algorithms

- **BioPython**: Biopython is a set of freely available tools for biological computation written in Python by an international team of developers.
