# Metaerg

## 0. Introduction
***Metaerg*** is a automated pipeline that uses third-party softwares aswell as a large database to annotate genomes or sets of bins from microbial ecosystems. Example of such annotations tasks are feature prediction with ***HMM***, ***BLAST*** and ***DIAMOND***.


learn more about ***Metaerg*** by reading from their [github repository](https://github.com/xiaoli-dong/metaerg)  and the following [article](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00999/full) in [frontiersin](https://www.frontiersin.org/) which was written by the same people who made ***Metaerg***.

## 1. Getting Started


### 1.1 Installation
There are many possibilites when it comes to install ***Metaerg***. One way is using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) which was not used since Elja does not currently provide any container support. Another possibility was to use [Easybuild](https://docs.easybuild.io/) which does not provide the latest version (only provides verison [1.2.3](https://docs.easybuild.io/version-specific/supported-software/#metaerg)) of ***Metaerg***. 
The third option that was chosen was to mannually install ***Metaerg*** and its other helper programs, starting by cloning [this](https://docs.easybuild.io/version-specific/supported-software/#metaerg) git repository and following its installation instructions and the requirements in the README.md file.

## 2 Run Metaerg on Elja

### 2.1 Loading Metaerg
Before being able to run ***Metaerg*** on Elja, you will have to load the ***Metaerg*** module. To do this you type these following commands in the terminal:

```bash
[..]$ ml use /hpcapps/lib-mimir/modules/all
[..]$ ml load Metaerg
```

### 2.2 Running Metaerg 
To run ***Metaerg*** you will have to type ```metaerg``` with parameters which you can find [here](https://github.com/kinestetika/MetaErg#usage). An example of a ***Metaerg*** run would look like this:

```bash
[..] $ metaerg --contig_file dir-with contig-files --database_dir /AlphaFoldData/MetaergData/
```

Note that **--database_dir /AlphaFoldData/MetaergData/** is always necessary as this is the location of the ***Metaerg*** database which the machine learned code is based on.
