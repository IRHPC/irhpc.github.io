# Etiquette

Congratulations on getting an account on one of the IRHPC clusters. The documentation here is applicable to all of the machines. Please read this page carefully, and if you are in any doubt on how to perform your tasks on the cluster do not hesitate to contact support.

# Login Node

The login node is a shared resource between all of the users. It controls the entire cluster, including SLURM which runs jobs and the queues. 

That is why it should only be used for the following simple tasks:
- Submit jobs
- Edit scripts and files
- Prepare / delete data (scp, cp, mv, rm etc.)
