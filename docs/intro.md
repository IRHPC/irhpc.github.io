# Acquiring Access

The resources provided by the Icelandic high performance computing centre (IHPC/IREI) are available to 
Icelandic universities and governmental research institutes. Scientists in independent 
research instututes may also gain access, provided their research is funded by public grants.

The expert panel of the IHPC/IREI grants access, and it is provided by two different means:

1. by cooperation through the Rann√≠s Infrastructure Fund (the Icelandic Centre for research).
2. by application. The formal application can be sent to "help@hi.is".

See more details [here](/files/rulesandreg-v1-2.pdf). A formal application should include a description of the project, the estimated time for completion and the type of software and resource required to complete the project. 

# Logging In

## Externally
We log into the Elja front-facing node:

```bash
$ ssh uname@elja.hi.is
# Or if you are juggling many .ssh keys
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_elja uname@elja.hi.is
```

Congratulations on getting to login node! 

See the section on SSH keys and Connecting for instructions.
